# Digit Recognition with PyTorch and Pygame

This repository combines the power of deep learning with PyTorch and the interactivity of Pygame to create a fun and educational digit recognition project. The project allows users to draw digits in real-time on a Pygame display and uses trained models, including ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), to predict the drawn digit.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing Interface:** Utilize the `paint.py` script to draw digits in real-time on a Pygame display.
  
- **Model Selection:** Train and test different deep learning models, such as ResNet and Vision Transformer, using the `train.py` script. Easily switch between models and observe their performance.

- **Adjustable Hyperparameters:** Experiment with hyperparameters like learning rate, epochs, and batch size to fine-tune the model's accuracy.
